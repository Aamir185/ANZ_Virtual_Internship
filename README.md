The internship consisted of two parts,

# Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Task:
For the first task, a synthesised tranasaction dataset with three months of transactions for 100 fictitious customers. The task is to clean and transform the dataset, to identify trends and patterns, which is to be presented to ANZ management. 

## Solution:
I employed PowerBI for exploration, transformation and visualization of the dataset. There are numerous other tools, but the motivation for PowerBI stemmed from the need to gain more practical exposure in PowerBI. 


Details about Part 2 will be coming soon
